Issue Number: #1333

Looks like there is no rating limit in the BeeF Login Portal, a user can brute 'n' number of time to get actual credentials of BeEF.
However: 

Access to the management interface should be restricted using the IP subnet access controls in a production deployment. 
This can be configured with the beef.restrictions.permitted_ui_subnet option in config.yaml.
The default username and password should also be changed to something more secure using the beef.credentials.user and beef.credentials.passwd 
options respectively.
The panel path should also be changed using the beef.http.web_ui_basepath configuration option in config.yaml. 
Admittedly this is security through obscurity and won't prevent attacks against the RESTful interface.
